## Step 3: Trying Some Commands
You are now connected to the remote computer and can now try out some commands. Some useful commands we went over were "ls" will show the files and folders in the directory, "cd" will change the directory to the given directory, "pwd" which will print the path of the working directory, and "mkdir" will make a directory with the given name,.
